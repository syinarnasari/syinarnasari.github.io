Can You Over Boil Meat? [Solved] It sounds odd, but meat can become dry even when it&amp;rsquo;s cooked in moisture. The most likely cause of this is overcooking. As meat cooks, its muscle fibers shorten in both length and width and eventually squeeze out the juices they normally hold. As you can imagine, this leaves meat dry, and often stringy in texture.</description>

Can You Have Wet And Dry Earwax? [Solved] That means if you get a &amp;ldquo;wet&amp;rdquo; version from either your mom or dad, you&amp;rsquo;ll probably have wet earwax. If you have dry earwax, it&amp;rsquo;s because both of your parents passed a &amp;ldquo;dry&amp;rdquo; version of the gene on to you. Wet earwax is a dominant trait, and dry is recessive.
